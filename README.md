# Move Mox Comic Files to Corresponding Folders

## Introduction

If you're also using the Mox website to download comics and have downloaded many comics at once, these files will pile up in the download folder. It can be time-consuming and laborious to create a folder for each comic and move the corresponding comics into the folders. This script will automatically check if a folder named after the comic exists, create one if it doesn't, and move the corresponding files into the appropriate folders.

## Usage

For the current Mox website version, the downloaded files should start with [Kox]. If they start with [Kox], run the bat file directly. If the files don't start with [Kox], right-click the bat file and open it with Notepad, then replace all [Kox] keywords with the corresponding file start keywords.

If you want to batch move other files with regular naming, you can also modify it to the regular keyword.
